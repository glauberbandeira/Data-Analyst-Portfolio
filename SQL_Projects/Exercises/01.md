### **Stock Analysis by Category and Period**

As a data analyst at Mestre Electronics, you have been assigned the task of analyzing stock levels over time.

Eduarda, the inventory supervisor, wants to understand how average stock quantities vary by product category over the months to better plan inventory management.

After discussing the data requirements for this analysis, it became clear that you need to provide a report calculating the average stock grouped by category and by year/month based on the stock count date. Additionally, the results should be sorted from the most recent to the oldest period and ranked by the highest average stock to facilitate Eduarda's analysis.

With these guidelines in mind, you accessed the SQL compiler connected to the company's database and started crafting the query that would deliver the expected results.

# **Stock Analysis by Category and Period**

This document outlines the queries and concepts used to analyze stock levels in a data analysis environment. Each section includes clear explanations to enhance understanding.

---

## **1. Overview**

As a data analyst at Mestre Electronics, the goal is to analyze stock levels over time to identify patterns and assist in decision-making for inventory management.

### **Scope of the Analysis**

The analysis aims to calculate the average stock:

1. Grouped by **product category**.
2. Organized by **year/month**.
3. Sorted by the **most recent period** and **highest average stock**.

---

## **2. Table Structures**

### **Table 1: `ft_estoque` | `ft_estoque`**

- **Count Date**: The date the stock was counted.
- **Product ID**: The identifier for the product.
- **Stock Quantity**: The recorded stock quantity.

### **Table 2: `dim_produto` | `dim_produto`**

- **Product ID**: The identifier for the product.
- **Category**: The main category of the product.

## **3. Simplified SQL Query**

### **Query to Calculate Average Stock**

```sql
SELECT
    strftime('%Y-%m', fe.[Data Contagem]) AS anoMes,
    dp.Categoria,
    AVG(fe.[Qtd Estoque]) AS EstoqueMedio
FROM
    ft_estoque fe
INNER JOIN
    dim_produto dp
    ON fe.[ID Produto] = dp.[ID Produto]
GROUP BY
    strftime('%Y-%m', fe.[Data Contagem]),
    dp.Categoria
ORDER BY
    anoMes DESC,
    EstoqueMedio DESC;
```

---

## **4. Query Explanation**

1. **`strftime` Function**:
   - Converts the `Data Contagem` column to the `YYYY-MM` format (year and month) for monthly grouping.

2. **Join (`INNER JOIN`)**:
   - Combines the `ft_estoque` and `dim_produto` tables using the `ID Produto` column, allowing access to product categories.

3. **Average Calculation (`AVG`)**:
   - Calculates the average stock quantity for each combination of `anoMes` and `Categoria`.

4. **Grouping (`GROUP BY`)**:
   - Groups data by period (`strftime('%Y-%m')`) and category (`Categoria`).

5. **Sorting (`ORDER BY`)**:
   - Sorts results by the most recent period (`anoMes DESC`) and the highest average stock (`EstoqueMedio DESC`).

## **5. Example Output**

```plaintext
| anoMes  | Category              | AverageStock |
| ------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| 2019-03 | Cell phones           | 297.5        |
| 2019-03 | Computers             | 276.5        |
| 2019-03 | Cameras and camcorders| 254.67       |
| ...     | ...                   | ...          |
```
